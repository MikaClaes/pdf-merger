# PDF Merger

## 📌 Overview

This is a small desktop app I built using Python and Tkinter that lets you select multiple PDF files, pick a save location, name the final file, and merge them into one.

I made this project to practice working with file dialogs, GUI design, and libraries like `pypdf`. It’s not meant to be a polished commercial app, but it’s still fully usable if you ever need to merge PDFs quickly without uploading them online.

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me practice working with **Tkinter** for GUI development and handling **file dialogs**, **listboxes**, and **user inputs**. I also learned how to use **PyPDF** to merge PDFs and how to build a working `.exe` using **PyInstaller**. On top of that, I got experience structuring a small but complete Python project, splitting logic from UI, and writing a clear README.
